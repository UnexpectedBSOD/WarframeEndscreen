# WarframeEndscreen
Custom endscreens for Warframe! **This is a POC!**

Idea based on UI discussion on Reddit.

Implementation based on log parsing as seen in [warframe-deathlog](https://github.com/WFCD/warframe-deathlog).

Uses [CEF Python](https://github.com/cztomczak/cefpython):

```bash
pip install cefpython3==66.0
```
